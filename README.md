# attendy
Created this attendance tracking website for the teachers, while tracking and recording several aspects of the user.

When I saw my teachers marking attendance of their students via manually or via some google forms, which had much higher rate of proxies. So I decided to think for a solution and then came up with this idea.
In this project, several aspects of a user were tracked and on the basis of those, this application was created. Like, timing parameters, random codes, location, their accuracy, roll numbers and device address all were recorded at a same time, and to the user the interface was very simple.
Just a single textbox and a submit button.

And in the backend teacher was provided with a google sheet, which stores all the data of the students present in that class.
